> To reduce the booting time of consumer electronics with general-purpose operating systems (a.k.a. smart devices), developers have used various approaches, including hiber- nation [26] and suspend-to-RAM [20]. With a continuous power supply, a device may use suspend-to-RAM, which stores all hardware states into RAM and keeps RAM pow- ered while users consider the device to be turned off (most smart phones do this). However, many consumers are suffi- ciently sensitive to energy consumption to unplug TVs while not in use (terminating suspend-to-RAM), and complain of subsequent slower booting.We have been using suspend-to- RAMapproaches for high-end TVs to meet the booting time requirement and have received such complaints. Another popular approach is hibernation, which stores all states, including volatile memory (DRAM) contents in non- volatile memory (flash memory and hard disk drives) and re- stores the states upon booting [26]. We have been applying such methods to digital cameras with Tizen, and achieved a booting time of less than 2 s for the NX-300, which does not support third-party applications. If the initial states after booting are not constant due to third-party applications and user customization, the stored hibernation images must be updated, which may trigger a critical issue. Updating hiber- nation images require excessive time for device power off, and so users cannot turn the device on or unplug it imme- diately after turning it off. Thus, for smart TVs, cold boot (conventional booting) performance is critical.
